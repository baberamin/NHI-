# NHI-
Example NHI Dashboard with multiple roles
The Saviynt NHI Security Platform is an interactive prototype that demonstrates enterprise-grade security posture management for Non-Human Identities (NHIs), including service accounts, API keys, AI agents, and MCP endpoints. Built with dual personas, the platform offers executives a CISO view with business risk quantification, live threat intelligence feeds, and AI-powered remediation recommendations, while IT administrators get an operations-focused dashboard with actionable task queues, credential rotation workflows, and real-time anomaly detection. The simulation showcases how organizations can reduce security risk through automated discovery, intelligent prioritization, and cross-team collaboration—featuring premium capabilities like AI Agent Risk Intelligence, MCP Endpoint Discovery, and Saviynt's AI Auto-Fix technology that can automatically remediate vulnerabilities with zero-touch automation.

Step-by-Step Use Case
Scenario: Detecting and Remediating a Critical Security Threat
Step 1: CISO Discovers Risk

Select the CISO persona on the landing page
View the real-time Risk Exposure Dial showing $3.2M in current risk
Notice the Live Threat Intelligence Feed alerting about active exploitation of a SWIFT vulnerability targeting banking APIs
Observe that threat intelligence has increased your risk exposure by 40%

Step 2: Review AI-Powered Recommendation
Scroll to Risk Reduction Recommendations
See the top critical priority: "Rotate Stale SWIFT API Key" marked with (TI-driven)
Note the potential impact: $1.5M risk reduction with only 4 hours of effort
Click "Assign to IT" to delegate the task to the IT Admin team

Step 3: Switch to IT Admin View
Click "Switch to IT Admin View" in the top navigation
See the task appear in Tasks Assigned by CISO section
View the Anomalous Access Detected panel showing 47 suspicious activities
Notice a critical anomaly: "Treasury Management API" accessed from Russia

Step 4: Take Action on Threats
Click "Block" on the critical anomaly from Russia
Watch the toast notification slide in: "Blocked Successfully"
See the button change to a green "Blocked Successfully" status indicator
Observe your Health Score increase from 78 → 83

Step 5: Complete Assigned Tasks
Scroll to Tasks Assigned by CISO
Click "Complete Task" on the SWIFT API key rotation
See success notification and task move to Recently Completed
Note the $1.5M risk reduction being logged

Step 6: Process Credential Rotations
View Rotation Efficiency showing 52 completed, 48 remaining
Click "Process Next Batch" to rotate 10 more credentials
Watch progress bar increase from 52% → 62%
Get a success toast notification for batch completion

Step 7: Return to CISO View to See Impact
Click "Switch to CISO View" in navigation
Observe the Risk Exposure Dial now showing reduced risk: $3.2M → $1.8M
See the green banner: "Risk Reduction Active: 1 simulated + IT tasks completed"
View the IT Admin's completed actions in the live feed
Confirm 44% risk reduction achieved through collaborative remediation

Step 8: Explore Premium Features
Click Unlock AI Agent Monitoring to see the premium feature modal
Review benefits: 94% reduction in AI-related breaches, $180K saved annually
Click "Proceed with Demo" to unlock the feature
Explore AI Agent Risk Exposure dial and agent inventory
View MCP Endpoint Discovery showing unmanaged endpoints

Step 9: Reset and Replay
Click the Reset Simulation button (red button in top nav)
Page reloads to the initial state for another demo run
