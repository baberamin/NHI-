# NHI-
Example NHI Dashboard with multiple roles
The Saviynt NHI Security Platform is an interactive prototype that demonstrates enterprise-grade security posture management for Non-Human Identities (NHIs), including service accounts, API keys, AI agents, and MCP endpoints. Built with dual personas, the platform offers executives a CISO view with business risk quantification, live threat intelligence feeds, and AI-powered remediation recommendations, while IT administrators get an operations-focused dashboard with actionable task queues, credential rotation workflows, and real-time anomaly detection. The simulation showcases how organizations can reduce security risk through automated discovery, intelligent prioritization, and cross-team collaborationâ€”featuring premium capabilities like AI Agent Risk Intelligence, MCP Endpoint Discovery, and Saviynt's AI Auto-Fix technology that can automatically remediate vulnerabilities with zero-touch automation.
